Image super-resolution (SR) techniques are used to generate a high-resolution image from a low-resolution image. Until now, deep generative models such as autoregressive models and Generative Adver- sarial Networks (GANs) have proven to be effective at modelling high- resolution images. VAE-based models have often been criticised for their feeble generative performance, but with new advancements such as VD- VAE, there is now strong evidence that deep VAEs have the potential to outperform current state-of-the-art models for high-resolution image generation. In this paper, we introduce VDVAE-SR, a new model that aims to exploit the most recent deep VAE methodologies to improve upon the results of similar models. VDVAE-SR tackles image super-resolution using transfer learning on pretrained VDVAEs. The presented model is competitive with other state-of-the-art models, having comparable re- sults on image quality metrics.\\n\\nKeywords: VDVAE; SR; Single-image super-resolution; Deep Varia- tional Autoencoders; Transfer learning\\n1 Introduction\\n\\nImage super-resolution (SR) is an image enhancement technique used to generate a high-resolution (HR) image from a low-resolution (LR) image. The task of SR is to reconstruct a high-resolution image from a single low-resolution image, or from multiple low-resolution images.\\n\\nSR techniques are used in a variety of applications, such as medical imaging, satellite imaging, and photography. The goal of SR is to recover as much detail as possible from the LR image to obtain a HR image.\\n\\nDeep generative models, such as autoregressive models and GANs, have been proven to be effective at modelling high-resolution images. However, VAE-based models have often been criticised for their weak generative performance. Recent advancements, such as VDVAE, have shown that deep VAEs have the potential to outperform current state-of-the-art models for high-resolution image generation.\\n\\nIn this paper, we introduce VDVAE-SR, a new model that aims to'"

Image super-resolution (SR) techniques are used to generate a high-resolution image from a low-resolution image. Until now, deep generative models such as autoregressive models and Generative Adver- sarial Networks (GANs) have proven to be effective at modelling high- resolution images. VAE-based models have often been criticised for their feeble generative performance, but with new advancements such as VD- VAE, there is now strong evidence that deep VAEs have the potential to outperform current state-of-the-art models for high-resolution image generation. In this paper, we introduce VDVAE-SR, a new model that aims to exploit the most recent deep VAE methodologies to improve upon the results of similar models. VDVAE-SR tackles image super-resolution using transfer learning on pretrained VDVAEs. The presented model is competitive with other state-of-the-art models, having comparable re- sults on image quality metrics.\\n\\nKeywords: VDVAE; SR; Single-image super-resolution; Deep Varia- tional Autoencoders; Transfer learning'),\n",

Image super-resolution has long been considered one of the most arduous challenges in image processing. This is yet another computer vision task that was transformed by the deep learning revolu- tion and has potential applications including but not limited to medical imaging, security, computer graphics, and surveillance.\\n\\nDeep generative models have been shown to excel at image generation. This is particularly true for autoregressive models [42,34,33,5,35] and Generative Ad- versarial Networks (GAN) [12,47,19,4], whereas Variational Autoencoders (VAE)\\n\\n⋆ Equal contribution, alphabetical order.

Haralampiev, et al.\\n\\n[21,37] have long been thought to be unable to produce high-quality samples. However, recent improvements in VAE design, such as using a hierarchy of latent variables and increasing depth [23,28,43,6] have demonstrated that deep VAEs can compete with both GANs and autoregressive models for high-resolution image generation. The current state-of-the-art VAE is the Very Deep Varia- tional Autoencoder (VDVAE) [6] which successfully scales to 78 stochastic lay- ers, whereas previous work only experimented with up to 40 layers [43].\\n\\nSince the VAE is an unconditional generative model, in order to perform image super-resolution it has to be turned into a conditional generative model which generates data depending on additional conditioning data. This can be achieved by using the framework of Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAE) [39], where the prior is conditioned on an additional random variable and pa- rameterized by a neural network. In this work, we introduce VDVAE-SR, a VDVAE conditioned on low-resolution images by adding a new component that we call LR-encoder as it resembles the encoder of the original VDVAE. This component is connected to the decoder, passing information on each layer in the top-down path both to the prior and the approximate posterior. During train- ing, the latent distributions of the low- and high-resolution images are matched using the KL divergence term in the evidence lower bound (ELBO). The learned information is used in generative mode, where only the low-resolution image is included in the model.\\n\\nA drawback of deep models such as the VDVAE is that they require a large amount of computing and training time. One way to compensate in that regard is to apply transfer learning and utilize a pre-trained model in order to speed up the process. However, this is not always straightforward in practice as pre- senting a pre-trained model with new data could lead to exploding gradients. This is particularly relevant for deep variational autoencoders as they are prone to unstable training and can be sensitive to hyperparameters changes. We show that using transfer learning for such a model is possible, and we describe the methods to do so, by making only certain parts of the network trainable and using gate parameters to stabilise the process.'),\n",

We evaluate the fine-tuned model on a number of common datasets in the literature of single image super-resolution: Set5 [3], Set14 [45], Urban100 [16], BSD100 [29], and Manga109 [30]. Following previous work [24,44,32], we test our approach both quantitatively, in terms of PSNR and SSIM metrics, and qualitatively, by visually inspecting the generated images, and compare our results against three state-of-the-art super-resolution methods: EDSR [26], ESRGAN [44] and RFANet [27]. We investigate the role of the sampling temperature, which controls the variance of samples at each stochastic layer in VDVAEs, and show results generated with low and high temperatures. By sampling with a lower tempera- ture, the model achieves quantitative scores better than ESRGAN, but slightly lower than EDSR. At the same time, qualitatively, when sampling with a higher temperature, the images look sharper and less blurred than those generated by\\n\\nImage Super-Resolution With Deep Variational Autoencoders\\n\\nthe EDSR model. Even though, in general, ESRGAN generates sharper images, it is prone to produce more artifacts as well. We believe that our proposed method shows a good compromise between visual artifacts and image sharpness. We summarize our contributions as follows:\\n\\n1. We propose VDVAE-SR, an adaptation of very deep VAEs (VDVAEs) for the task of single image super-resolution. VDVAE-SR introduces an additional component that we call LR-encoder, which takes the low-resolution image as input, while its output is used to condition the prior.\\n\\n2. We show how to utilize transfer learning and achieve stable training in order to take advantage of a VDVAE model already pre-trained on 32 V100 GPUs for 2.5 weeks.\\n\\n3. We present competitive qualitative and quantitative results compared to state-of-the-art methods on popular test datasets for 4x upscaling.'),\n",

Later, with the proposal of residual neural networks (ResNets) [13], which provide fast training and better perfor- mance for deep architectures, numerous works have adapted ResNets-based mod- els to the task of super-resolution, such as SR-ResNet [24] and SR-DenseNet [41]. One of the frequently used CNN-based super-resolution models in comparative studies is EDSR [26], where the authors use ResNets without batch normaliza- tion in the residual block, achieving impressive results and getting first place on the NTIRE2017 Super-Resolution Challenge.\\n\\nIn terms of GAN-based image super-resolution models, several methods have gained a lot of popularity starting with SRGAN [24] where the authors argue that most popular metrics (PSNR, SSIM) do not necessarily reflect perceptually better SR results and that is why they use an extensive mean opinion score (MOS) for evaluating perceptual quality. With that in mind, SRGAN introduces a perceptual loss different from previous work, based on adversarial as well as content loss. Another method, ESRGAN [44], builds upon SRGAN by improving the network architecture removing all batch normalization layers and introducing a new Residual in Residual Dense Block (RRDB). In addition, an enhanced discriminator is used based on Relativistic GAN [18] and the features before the activation loss are used to improve perceptual loss.\\n\\nA recent work that uses VAEs for image super-resolution is the srVAE [11], which consists of a VAE with three latent variables, one of them being a down- scaled version of the original image. This work shows impressive generative per- formance in terms of FID score when tested on ImageNet-32 and CIFAR-10, but no quantitative results of their super-resolution model are reported. Another recent work that uses a VAE-based model for image super-resolution is VarSR [17]. This work focuses on very low-resolution images (8x8) and shows better results compared to some popular super-resolution methods.\\n\\nD. Chira, I. Haralampiev, et al.\\n\\nDeep VAEs such as [23,28,43,6] adapt their architecture from Ladder VAEs (LVAE) [40], which introduce a novel top-down inference model and achieve stable training with multiple stochastic layers. A method that improved upon the LVAE is the Bidirectional-Inference VAE (BIVA) [28] adding a deterministic top-down path in the generative model and applying a bidirectional inference network. These modifications solved the variable collapse issue of the LVAE which may occur when the architecture consists of a very deep hierarchy of stochastic latent variables. Recently, NVAE [43] reported further improvements by using normalizing flows in order to allow for more expressive distributions and thus outperform the state-of-the-art among non-autoregressive and VAE models. Finally, the VDVAE model [6] demonstrated that the number of stochastic layers matters greatly for performance, achieving better results than previous VAE- based models and some autoregressive ones, having the potential to outperform those as well.\\n\\nDenoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) [14] are the latest addi- tion to the family of probabilistic generative models. DDPMs define a diffusion process that progressively turns the input image into noise, and learn to syn- thesize images by inverting that process. DDPMs and variations thereof excel at high-resolution image generation [31,8] and have been successfully applied to the task of single image super-resolution [15,25].'),\n",

We then introduce the VDVAE using the VAE framework.\\n\\n3.1 Variational Autoencoders\\n\\nThe Variational Autoencoder [21] is a generative model built on probabilistic principles. It consists of a joint model pθ(x, z) = pθ(x|z)pθ(z) parameterized by θ and an approximate posterior qϕ(z|x) parameterized by ϕ. All models are implemented using neural networks. During generation, the latent variable z is sampled from the prior and the observation variable x is sampled from the observation model following z ∼ pθ(z), x ∼ pθ(x|z).\\n\\nVAE models are optimized with stochastic gradient ascent to maximize the\\n\\nmarginal likelihood:\\n\\npθ(x) = pθ(x|z)pθ(z)dz z (1)\\n\\nIn practice, pθ(x) is intractable of the integration over z, which makes the poste- rior pθ(z|x) also intractable. Variational Inference (VI) solves the intractability of pθ(z|x) using an approximate posterior qϕ(z|x). The resulting objective function, the evidence lower bound (ELBO), is further derived using Jensen’s inequality and expressed as:\\n\\nL(x; θ, ϕ) = Eqϕ(z|x) log pθ(x, z) qϕ(z|x) ≤ log pθ(x) . (2)\\n\\nImage Super-Resolution With Deep Variational Autoencoders\\n\\n3.2 Conditional Variational Autoencoders\\n\\nIn order to generate specific data as in the case of image super-resolution, where we need to generate a high-resolution image from its low-resolution counterpart, the Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAE) can be used.\\n\\nSimilar to the VAE, the CVAE is also built on probabilistic principles. CVAE is optimized to maximize the marginal probability similar to Eq.

This results in a more flexible prior and posterior compared to a simple diagonal Gaussian prior which could be too limiting. An iterative interaction between “bottom-up” and “top-down” layers is achieved through parameter sharing between the inference and generative models in each layer. The prior and the approximate posterior for a model with K stochastic layers factorize as:\\n\\npθ(z) = pθ(z0)pθ(z1|z0)...pθ(zK|z<K) (6)\\n\\nqϕ(z|x) = qϕ(z0|x)qϕ(z1|z0, x)...qϕ(zK|z<K, x) (7)\\n\\nwhere pθ(z0) is a diagonal Gaussian distribution N (z0 | 0, I) and the latent vari- able group z0 is at the top layer that corresponds to small number of latent variables at low resolution. Intuitively, zK is at the bottom of the network hav- ing a larger number of latent variables at high resolution.\\n\\nThe VDVAE architecture is composed of blocks of two types: the resid- ual blocks (bottom-up path) and the top-down blocks (Fig. 1). The top-down blocks are also residual and handle two tasks: processing the information flow- ing through the decoder and handling the stochasticity. Each top-down block of index j > 0 handles the distributions qϕ(zj|zj−1, x) and pθ(zj|zj−1). Top-down blocks are composed sequentially. Therefore, we can define hj as the input to\\n\\nD. Chira, I. Haralampiev, et al.\\n\\nthe top-down block of index j, where hj is a function of the samples z<j. This allows us to express the VDVAE model as:\\n\\npo(2) = po(%o) [[ po(zjlhy), — do(2Ix) = go(zolx) [[ ae@ilhy.x)- (8) j=l j=l\\n\\nInput HR Bottom-up { ‘Activations ee\" ee) Cea) Cem) (ena) Ss =a = Cc (ena) i a\\n\\nFig. 1.

We provide an overview of the model architecture, after which we detail the conditional prior network and its integration with the VDVAE model.\\n\\n4.1 LR-encoder\\n\\nThe dependency on the lower-resolution image y is implemented using the en- coder of a lower-resolution VDVAE of depth K ′ < K, which we call LR-encoder. The LR-encoder maps the lower-resolution image to latent space, providing one activation gj for each layer j ∈ [0, K ′]. Each activation gj is defined as the output of the bottom-up residual block of index j.'),\n",

Having multiple test datasets gives a better un- derstanding of the strengths and shortcomings of our model, since these datasets contain different types of pictures: BSD100, Set5, and Set14 mostly consist of natural images with a broad range of styles, while the focus on Urban100 is mainly on buildings and urban scenes, and Manga109 consists of drawings of Japanese manga.'),\n",

We use a pretrained VDVAE with a stochastic depth of 62 layers. Our method, VDVAE-SR, includes the original VDVAE encoder and decoder, which we initialize with the weights from the pretrained model. We then freeze the encoder, allow fine-tuning of the decoder, and train the LR-encoder from scratch. We optimize the model end-to-end for 100,000 steps using the Adam optimizer [20] with a learning rate of 5 · 10−4 and batch size of 1 on one NVIDIA V100 GPU.\\n\\nWhen using transfer learning, it was observed that the model suffered from exploding gradients if the new information from the LR-encoder was introduced in an uncontrolled manner. Introducing gate parameters similar to the approach in [2] significantly improved training stability.\\n\\n5.3 Evaluation\\n\\nIn terms of evaluation metrics, we use the traditional PSNR and SSIM quality measures, both widely used as metrics for image restoration tasks. While PSNR (Peak Signal to Noise Ratio) is calculated based on the mean squared error of the pixel-to-pixel difference, the SSIM (Structural Similarity Method) is consid- ered to have a closer correlation with human perception by calculating distortion levels based on comparisons of structure, luminance, and contrast. Additional to the traditional PSNR and SSIM metrics, we evaluate the produced images using the DISTS [9] score, which has showed evidence that the metric matches closer to human perception. We quantitatively evaluate different super-resolution meth- ods by applying them to low-resolution images and computing the PSNR, SSIM and DISTS metrics using the super-resolution output and the reference high- resolution image. For the PSNR and SSIM, all pictures are converted from RGB to YCbCr and the metrics are computed on the Y channel (luma component) of the pictures. The reason for this is that it has been observed (e.g., in [36]) that the results of evaluating on the luminosity channel in the YCbCr color space, rather than on the usual RGB representation, are closer to the actual perceived struc- tural noise of the image. We thus adopt the same approach, following prior work. Finally, note that the YCbCr space is used during the testing phase exclusively, while the training and validation are still performed in the RGB color space.\\n\\n10 D. Chira, I.

This is confirmed by the ob- tained scores of our method using different temperatures as decreasing the vari- ance produces more averaged-out images and thus higher scores. Based on the DISTS metric, ESRGAN performs best on three datasets. Our method with higher temperature follows on second place on the Set5 and BSDS100 datasets.\\n\\nQualitative Results. Figs. 4 to 6 show a visual comparison of two pictures from BSD100 dataset between the original HR image, Bicubic, EDSR, ESRGAN, RFANet and our method with both 0.1 and 0.8 temperatures.\\n\\nIt can be observed that the points made in the quantitative section still stand, as EDSR, having the best PSNR and SSIM scores, has a smoother and blurrier look, and our model with 0.1 temperature looks closer to it. As for the model with 0.8 temperature, it introduces more details compared to EDSR. It is still blurrier than the outputs of ESRGAN but has fewer artifacts and it is able to reproduce some details without introducing any generative noise. As for the RFANet, the images are still blurrier, but having more visual similarities with our method than EDSR. For this reason in most metrics it gets a better score, but visually it still does not generate highly detailed features.\\n\\nIn Figs. 4 and 5 it can be observed that ESRGAN produces some artifacts on the bull’s head and the person’s hand, while our model retains the structure of the objects. In Fig. 6 we can again see how the eye of the bird has a different shape and a more averaged-out look in the case of the EDSR, and even more drastic shape change in the case of the ESRGAN, while our models keep the rounder shape, while not averaging out the outer colors as much.\\n\\nImage Super-Resolution With Deep Variational Autoencoders\\n\\nHR EDSR VDVAE-SR (t=0.1) PSNR/SSIM 27.13/0.730 26.99/0. tos VDVAE-SR (t=0.8) 26.71/0.714 Bicubic ESRGAN RFANet Reference 25.94/0.679 24.35/0.616 25.59/0.637\\n\\nFig. 4.

The “temperature” parameter t, taking values between 0 and 1, is used in VDVAE when sampling from prior in generative mode, often resulting in higher-quality samples when lowered as observed in previous work [22,43]. Reducing the temperature results in reducing the variance of the Gaussian dis- tributions in the prior and so achieving more regularity in the generated samples. Fig. 7 shows examples of samples with different temperatures. We can observe how samples taken with a lower temperature look smoother, whereas those taken with a higher temperature have more details but also more artifacts. We corrob- orate this quantitatively in Fig. 8, which shows that the PSNR and SSIM scores (for Set5 and Set14) both decrease as the sampling temperature is increased.

A crucial parameter in our super-resolution method is the size of patches to which we apply super-resolution addressed also in [46,38]. After ex- perimenting with patches of size 16x16 and 64x64 (i.e., 64x64 and 256x256 after super-resolution), we observed that the 16x16 patch size models were generally performing worse than their counterparts with bigger patch sizes, both in terms of PSNR and SSIM, and in a perceptual sense as the models fail to recreate details that the 64x64 patch models have no problem with. This can also be seen in Fig. 9, especially on the bird’s eye, as the general shape and sharpness cannot be recreated by the 16x16 patch size model.\\n\\nWe hypothesise that as the patch size gets smaller, the amount of details found in a patch becomes lesser, and the models will not be able to recreate those details anymore based on context, as the patches will start to look more similar to each other and generic.\\n\\nImage Super-Resolution With Deep Variational Autoencoders\\n\\n— sets — setia — sets, oes — sets 84 82 PSNR. ssi 0.80 ora 02 a6 os vo a2 oa os os vo Temperature Temperature\\n\\nFig. 8.

After the introduction of the proposed VDVAE-SR model, and based on the results pre- sented, we conclude that the introduced model and its quantitative and qualita- tive results are satisfying as they are comparable to other popular methods, gen- erating images that compensate between image sharpness and visual artifacts. As being part of the scarce family of VAE-based models for image super-resolution and the first to our knowledge that uses a deep hierarchical architecture, we believe that our proposed method still has a lot of space for building upon, to improve the results even further, as multiple modifications such as changes to training time, layer architecture, or the use of more flexible distributions can be investigated in the future.\\n\\nImage Super-Resolution With Deep Variational Autoencoders'),\n",

The popular BSD100 dataset consists of images with a broad range of styles ranging from natural images to object-specific ones. We show results of our model with sampling temperature of 0.1, 0.8 and 1. Lower temperature reduces the variance of the Gaussian distributions of the prior, resulting in more averaged-out images, but also reducing noise. We believe that sampling with a temperature of t = 0.8 provides a good trade-off between noise reduction and preservation of details.\\n\\nImage Super-Resolution With Deep Variational Autoencoders\\n\\na) HR b) Bicubic c) EDSR d) ESRGAN e) VDVAE-SR, t = 0.1 f) VDVAE-SR, t = 0.8 g) VDVAE-SR, t = 1\\n\\nFig. 12.

We compare our method to three other super-resolution methods, namely EDSR, ESRGAN and RFANet, based on their official imple- mentation.

Evaluation metrics using PSNR and SSIM on the Y channel and DISTS. The number next to VDVAE-SR (our method) denotes the temperature used for sampling.

We evaluate the fine-tuned model on a number of common datasets in the literature of single image super-resolution: Set5 [3], Set14 [45], Urban100 [16], BSD100 [29], and Manga109 [30]. Following previous work [24,44,32], we test our approach both quantitatively, in terms of PSNR and SSIM metrics, and qualitatively, by visually inspecting the generated images, and compare our results against three state-of-the-art super-resolution methods: EDSR [26], ESRGAN [44] and RFANet [27]. We investigate the role of the sampling temperature, which controls the variance of samples at each stochastic layer in VDVAEs, and show results generated with low and high temperatures. By sampling with a lower tempera- ture, the model achieves quantitative scores better than ESRGAN, but slightly lower than EDSR. At the same time, qualitatively, when sampling with a higher temperature, the images look sharper and less blurred than those generated by\\n\\nImage Super-Resolution With Deep Variational Autoencoders\\n\\nthe EDSR model. Even though, in general, ESRGAN generates sharper images, it is prone to produce more artifacts as well. We believe that our proposed method shows a good compromise between visual artifacts and image sharpness. We summarize our contributions as follows:\\n\\n1. We propose VDVAE-SR, an adaptation of very deep VAEs (VDVAEs) for the task of single image super-resolution. VDVAE-SR introduces an additional component that we call LR-encoder, which takes the low-resolution image as input, while its output is used to condition the prior.\\n\\n2. We show how to utilize transfer learning and achieve stable training in order to take advantage of a VDVAE model already pre-trained on 32 V100 GPUs for 2.5 weeks.\\n\\n3. We present competitive qualitative and quantitative results compared to state-of-the-art methods on popular test datasets for 4x upscaling.\\n2 Related Work\\n\\nOne of the first successes in image super-resolution is the SR-CNN [10], which is based on a three-layer CNN structure and uses a bicubic interpolated low- resolution image as input to the network. Later, with the proposal of residual neural networks (ResNets) [13], which provide fast training and better perfor- mance for deep architectures, numerous works have adapted ResNets-based mod- els to the task of super-resolution, such as SR-ResNet [24] and SR-DenseNet [41]. One of the frequently used CNN-based super-resolution models in comparative studies is EDSR [26], where the authors use ResNets without batch normaliza- tion in the residual block, achieving impressive results and getting first place on the NTIRE2017 Super-Resolution Challenge.\\n\\nIn terms of GAN-based image super-resolution models, several methods have gained a lot of popularity starting with SRGAN [24] where the authors argue that most popular metrics (PSNR, SSIM) do not necessarily reflect perceptually better SR results and that is why they use an extensive mean opinion score (MOS) for evaluating perceptual quality. With that in mind, SRGAN introduces a perceptual loss different from previous work, based on adversarial as well as content loss. Another method, ESRGAN [44], builds upon SRGAN by improving the network architecture removing all batch normalization layers and introducing a new Residual in Residual Dense Block (RRDB). In addition, an enhanced discriminator is used based on Relativistic GAN [18] and the features before the activation loss are used to improve perceptual loss.\\n\\nA recent work that uses VAEs for image super-resolution is the srVAE [11], which consists of a VAE with three latent variables, one of them being a down- scaled version of the original image. This work shows impressive generative per- formance in terms of FID score when tested on ImageNet-32 and CIFAR-10, but no quantitative results of their super-resolution model are reported. Another recent work that uses a VAE-based model for image super-resolution is VarSR [17]. This work focuses on very low-resolution images (8x8) and shows better results compared to some popular super-resolution methods.\\n\\nD. Chira, I. Haralampiev, et al.\\n\\nDeep VAEs such as [23,28,43,6] adapt their architecture from Ladder VAEs (LVAE) [40], which introduce a novel top-down inference model and achieve stable training with multiple stochastic layers. A method that improved upon the LVAE is the Bidirectional-Inference VAE (BIVA) [28] adding a deterministic top-down path in the generative model and applying a bidirectional inference network. These modifications solved the variable collapse issue of the LVAE which may occur when the architecture consists of a very deep hierarchy of stochastic latent variables. Recently, NVAE [43] reported further improvements by using normalizing flows in order to allow for more expressive distributions and thus outperform the state-of-the-art among non-autoregressive and VAE models. Finally, the VDVAE model [6] demonstrated that the number of stochastic layers matters greatly for performance, achieving better results than previous VAE- based models and some autoregressive ones, having the potential to outperform those as well.\\n\\nDenoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) [14] are the latest addi- tion to the family of probabilistic generative models. DDPMs define a diffusion process that progressively turns the input image into noise, and learn to syn- thesize images by inverting that process. DDPMs and variations thereof excel at high-resolution image generation [31,8] and have been successfully applied to the task of single image super-resolution [15,25].\\n\\n                Answer:\\n            '}]://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/5/616\n            'https://doi.org/10.3390/s13050616\n            '\n            'The model super resolution performance metrics like PSNR on different testing datasets like Urban 100, Set5, Set14, BSD100, and Manga109 is shown in Table 1.

The quantitative results on PSNR and SSIM are shown in the table, where VDVAE-SR (with temperature t=0.1) achieves quantitative scores better than ESRGAN but slightly lower than EDSR.

One of the frequently used CNN-based super-resolution models in comparative studies is EDSR [26], where the authors use ResNets without batch normaliza- tion in the residual block, achieving impressive results and getting first place on the NTIRE2017 Super-Resolution Challenge.\n\nIn terms of GAN-based image super-resolution models, several methods have gained a lot of popularity starting with SRGAN [24] where the authors argue that most popular metrics (PSNR, SSIM) do not necessarily reflect perceptually better SR results and that is why they use an extensive mean opinion score (MOS) for evaluating perceptual quality. With that in mind, SRGAN introduces a perceptual loss different from previous work, based on adversarial as well as content loss. Another method, ESRGAN [44], builds upon SRGAN by improving the network architecture removing all batch normalization layers and introducing a new Residual in Residual Dense Block (RRDB). In addition, an enhanced discriminator is used based on Relativistic GAN [18] and the features before the activation loss are used to improve perceptual loss.\n\nA recent work that uses VAEs for image super-resolution is the srVAE [11], which consists of a VAE with three latent variables, one of them being a down- scaled version of the original image. This work shows impressive generative per- formance in terms of FID score when tested on ImageNet-32 and CIFAR-10, but no quantitative results of their super-resolution model are reported. Another recent work that uses a VAE-based model for image super-resolution is VarSR [17].

A method that improved upon the LVAE is the Bidirectional-Inference VAE (BIVA) [28] adding a deterministic top-down path in the generative model and applying a bidirectional inference network. These modifications solved the variable collapse issue of the LVAE which may occur when the architecture consists of a very deep hierarchy of stochastic latent variables. Recently, NVAE [43] reported further improvements by using normalizing flows in order to allow for more expressive distributions and thus outperform the state-of-the-art among non-autoregressive and VAE models.

We use a pretrained VDVAE with a stochastic depth of 62 layers. Our method, VDVAE-SR, includes the original VDVAE encoder and decoder, which we initialize with the weights from the pretrained model. We then freeze the encoder, allow fine-tuning of the decoder, and train the LR-encoder from scratch. We optimize the model end-to-end for 100,000 steps using the Adam optimizer [20] with a learning rate of 5 · 10−4 and batch size of 1 on one NVIDIA V100 GPU.\\n\\nWhen using transfer learning, it was observed that the model suffered from exploding gradients if the new information from the LR-encoder was introduced in an uncontrolled manner. Introducing gate parameters similar to the approach in [2] significantly improved training stability.\\n\\n5.3 Evaluation\\n\\nIn terms of evaluation metrics, we use the traditional PSNR and SSIM quality measures, both widely used as metrics for image restoration tasks. While PSNR (Peak Signal to Noise Ratio) is calculated based on the mean squared error of the pixel-to-pixel difference, the SSIM (Structural Similarity Method) is consid- ered to have a closer correlation with human perception by calculating distortion levels based on comparisons of structure, luminance, and contrast. Additional to the traditional PSNR and SSIM metrics, we evaluate the produced images using the DISTS [9] score, which has showed evidence that the metric matches closer to human perception. We quantitatively evaluate different super-resolution meth- ods by applying them to low-resolution images and computing the PSNR, SSIM and DISTS metrics using the super-resolution output and the reference high- resolution image. For the PSNR and SSIM, all pictures are converted from RGB to YCbCr and the metrics are computed on the Y channel (luma component) of the pictures. The reason for this is that it has been observed (e.g., in [36]) that the results of evaluating on the luminosity channel in the YCbCr color space, rather than on the usual RGB representation, are closer to the actual perceived struc- tural noise of the image. We thus adopt the same approach, following prior work. Finally, note that the YCbCr space is used during the testing phase exclusively, while the training and validation are still performed in the RGB color space.\\n\\n10 D. Chira, I.

After ex- perimenting with patches of size 16x16 and 64x64 (i.e., 64x64 and 256x256 after super-resolution), we observed that the 16x16 patch size models were generally performing worse than their counterparts with bigger patch sizes, both in terms of PSNR and SSIM, and in a perceptual sense as the models fail to recreate details that the 64x64 patch models have no problem with. This can also be seen in Fig. 9, especially on the bird’s eye, as the general shape and sharpness cannot be recreated by the 16x16 patch size model.\\n\\nWe hypothesise that as the patch size gets smaller, the amount of details found in a patch becomes lesser, and the models will not be able to recreate those details anymore based on context, as the patches will start to look more similar to each other and generic.\\n\\nImage Super-Resolution With Deep Variational Autoencoders\\n\\n— sets — setia — sets, oes — sets 84 82 PSNR. ssi 0.80 ora 02 a6 os vo a2 oa os os vo Temperature Temperature\\n\\nFig. 8.

In addition, an enhanced discriminator is used based on Relativistic GAN [18] and the features before the activation loss are used to improve perceptual loss.\n\nA recent work that uses VAEs for image super-resolution is the srVAE [11], which consists of a VAE with three latent variables, one of them being a down- scaled version of the original image. This work shows impressive generative per- formance in terms of FID score when tested on ImageNet-32 and CIFAR-10, but no quantitative results of their super-resolution model are reported. Another recent work that uses a VAE-based model for image super-resolution is VarSR [17]. This work focuses on very low-resolution images (8x8) and shows better results compared to some popular super-resolution methods.\n\nD. Chira, I. Haralampiev, et al.\n\nDeep VAEs such as [23,28,43,6] adapt their architecture from Ladder VAEs (LVAE) [40], which introduce a novel top-down inference model and achieve stable training with multiple stochastic layers. A method that improved upon the LVAE is the Bidirectional-Inference VAE (BIVA) [28] adding a deterministic top-down path in the generative model and applying a bidirectional inference network. These modifications solved the variable collapse issue of the LVAE which may occur when the architecture consists of a very deep hierarchy of stochastic latent variables. Recently, NVAE [43] reported further improvements by using normalizing flows in order to allow for more expressive distributions and thus outperform the state-of-the-art among non-autoregressive and VAE models. Finally, the VDVAE model [6] demonstrated that the number of stochastic layers matters greatly for performance, achieving better results than previous VAE- based models and some autoregressive ones, having the potential to outperform those as well.\n\nDenoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) [14] are the latest addi- tion to the family of probabilistic generative models. DDPMs define a diffusion process that progressively turns the input image into noise, and learn to syn- thesize images by inverting that process. DDPMs and variations thereof excel at high-resolution image generation [31,8] and have been successfully applied to the task of single image super-resolution [15,25]."
